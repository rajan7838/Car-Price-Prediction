This project predicts car selling prices using supervised machine learning. I used both categorical and numerical features such as brand, model, vehicle age, mileage, and engine specifications. Categorical features were handled using one-hot encoding, and numerical features were scaled. I trained Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and SVR using a unified pipeline and applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The best-performing model was saved and deployed using Streamlit for real-time price prediction.
